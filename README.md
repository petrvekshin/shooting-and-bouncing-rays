[Shooting and Bouncing Rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_and_bouncing_rays) Solver Based on [Havel-Herout Ray-Triangle Intersection Algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41910471_Yet_Faster_Ray-Triangle_Intersection_Using_SSE4) for Ray-Tracing

The core of this solver is written in C using Numpy for memory allocation. Doing so allows to avoid creating of `n_triangles` by `n_rays` arrays (creating 1D arrays of the size `n_rays` instead) and decreases the number of operations needed to find intersections. The Python part is poorly coded and is provided for demonstration purposes only. The solver has bugs that can lead to incorrect results when a dielectric covering is present and there are multiple reflections (PEC case works fine).
